# JishoBot
A bot that provides Japanese definitions and translations to anyone who needs them.

## Commands

| Command | Arguments | Description                                                  |
| ------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| j!      | (term)    | Try to retrieve the definition for the given term. This can be a word or a single character. When a phrase is supplied it will try to use the first word in the phrase |
| j!about |           | Shows some information about the bot/project                 |
| j!help  |           | Shows a help message listing the commands and how to use them |

If a message is sent in a channel called "jisho-bot" the bot will automatically look up the definition without having to supply the `j!` command
